Code for the SE31520/CHM5820 CSA (CS Alumni Application), csa-server-for-rest-client

This version corresponds to the example used in the lectures on REST and Rails.
This repository also contains a REST client under the folder rest-client. 
This can be run with the command:

ruby csa_rest_client.rb

The client hard-codes the API URL http://localhost:3000 which you will
want to change if you run the server on a different host.

A series of further version will be provided as the module progresses.


* Ruby version
This has been developed with ruby 2.4.1

* Database creation
An example development database is included

* Installation dependencies
ImageMagick must be installed

*  Testing
No extra tests were developed during this workshop, only those generated automatically
